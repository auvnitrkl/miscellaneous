# Sample Qt App

To run this app:-
1. Put this package in src folder of a catkin workspace.
2. ``` sudo apt-get install ros-<distro>-qt-ros ```
3. Build the package (``` catkin_make ```) and source the workspace.
4. ``` rosrun sample_qt_app app ```

### Note
This package does absolutely nothing. This is just a guideline to making Qt apps for ROS.
